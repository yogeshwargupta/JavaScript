# Javascript and Classes
Yes, JavaScript has classes, although they are a syntactical sugar over the prototype-based inheritance model that JavaScript traditionally used. Introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), classes in JavaScript provide a way to create blueprints for objects with properties and methods. They allow you to create objects based on a template, which can be helpful for organizing code and creating reusable components.
